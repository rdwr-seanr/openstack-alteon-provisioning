## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 🔒 For Security Issues

**DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please:

1. **Email us directly** at security@yourorganization.com
2. **Include detailed information** about the vulnerability
3. **Provide steps to reproduce** the issue
4. **Suggest a fix** if you have one

### 📧 What to Include

When reporting a security issue, please include:

- **Description** of the vulnerability
- **Steps to reproduce** the issue
- **Potential impact** assessment
- **Affected versions** if known
- **Suggested mitigation** or fix
- **Your contact information** for follow-up

### ⏱️ Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment:** Within 24 hours
- **Initial assessment:** Within 72 hours
- **Regular updates:** Every 7 days
- **Resolution:** Depends on severity and complexity

### 🛡️ Security Best Practices

When using this project:

1. **Use strong passwords** for Alteon admin accounts
2. **Restrict network access** through security groups
3. **Keep images updated** to the latest Alteon versions
4. **Monitor access logs** and unusual activities
5. **Use encrypted connections** (HTTPS, SSH)
6. **Implement proper key management** for SSH keys
7. **Regular security audits** of your deployments

### 🔍 Known Security Considerations

#### Network Security
- Default security groups allow broad access for demonstration
- Restrict source IP ranges in production environments
- Use VPN or bastion hosts for management access

#### Authentication
- Change default passwords immediately after deployment
- Use SSH key authentication instead of passwords
- Implement multi-factor authentication where possible

#### Data Protection
- Ensure terraform state files are secured
- Don't commit sensitive data to version control
- Use encrypted storage for backups

### 📋 Security Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Updated all default passwords
- [ ] Configured restrictive security groups
- [ ] Enabled logging and monitoring
- [ ] Implemented backup procedures
- [ ] Tested disaster recovery
- [ ] Reviewed network architecture
- [ ] Validated SSL/TLS configurations
- [ ] Secured management interfaces

### 🚨 Incident Response

If you suspect a security incident:

1. **Isolate** affected systems
2. **Document** what happened
3. **Report** the incident to security team
4. **Preserve** evidence for analysis
5. **Implement** corrective measures
6. **Review** and improve security practices
